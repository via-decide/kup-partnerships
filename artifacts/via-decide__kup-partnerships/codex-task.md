You are working in repository via-decide/kup-partnerships on branch main.

MISSION
Build the 'Pilot Proposal' generator in src/docs/nhai-brief-gen.js. [span_20](start_span)[span_21](start_span)This module must pull real accuracy and cost-per-lane metrics from the kup-ai-stack and format them into a formal NHAI technical brief[span_20](end_span)[span_21](end_span). [span_22](start_span)constraints: Specifically highlight the 40% reduction in blowout risk through under-inflation detection[span_22](end_span). [span_23](start_span)Ensure the document includes the "Reference Architecture" for extreme climates as specified in Research Output 3[span_23](end_span).

CONSTRAINTS
Preserve existing code; prefer additive changes.

PROCESS (MANDATORY)
1. Read README.md and AGENTS.md before editing.
2. Audit architecture before coding. Summarize current behavior.
3. Preserve unrelated working code. Prefer additive modular changes.
4. Implement the smallest safe change set for the stated goal.
5. Run validation commands and fix discovered issues.
6. Self-review for regressions, missing env wiring, and docs drift.
7. Return complete final file contents for every modified or created file.

SOP: PRE-MODIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Adherence to Instructions: No deviations without explicit user approval.
2. Mandatory Clarification: Immediately ask if instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.
3. Proposal First: Always propose optimizations or fixes before implementing them.
4. Scope Discipline: Do not add unrequested features or modify unrelated code.
5. Vulnerability Check: Immediately flag and explain security risks.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Include: implementation summary, checks run, risks, rollback notes.
- Generate branch + PR package.
- Keep prompts deterministic and preservation-first.
